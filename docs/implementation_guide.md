## Continuous Integration Workflow

The CI workflow (`ci.yml`) automates testing and validation of code changes.

### Workflow Triggers

The CI workflow is triggered on:
- Push to main and develop branches
- Pull requests to main and develop branches
- Only when relevant files are changed (src/, tests/, package.json, etc.)

### Jobs

1. **Lint**: Checks code quality using ESLint
2. **Test**: Runs unit and integration tests with Jest
3. **Build**: Creates a build artifact for deployment

### Key Features

- **Matrix Testing**: Can be configured to test across multiple Node.js versions
- **Dependency Caching**: Caches npm dependencies for faster builds
- **Artifact Generation**: Creates and uploads build artifacts
- **Environment Variables**: Sets up test environment automatically

### Usage Example

```yaml
# Trigger CI workflow manually
name: Manual CI Run

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  trigger_ci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger CI workflow
        uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1
        with:
          workflow: CI Pipeline
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Continuous Deployment Workflow

The CD workflow (`cd.yml`) automates deployment to different environments.

### Workflow Triggers

The CD workflow is triggered on:
- Push to main branch (auto-deploy to development)
- Manual dispatch with environment selection
- Only when relevant files are changed (src/, package.json, etc.)

### Jobs

1. **Prepare**: Creates deployment package with environment-specific configuration
2. **Deploy**: Deploys to the specified environment
3. **Verify**: Runs post-deployment verification

### Deployment Environments

- **Development**: Automatic deployment on push to main
- **Staging**: Manual deployment with approval
- **Production**: Manual deployment with approval and additional safeguards

### Key Features

- **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Different settings for each environment
- **Approval Gates**: Required approvals for production deployments
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic rollback on failed deployments
- **Smoke Tests**: Post-deployment verification

### Usage Example

```yaml
# Trigger deployment to staging
name: Deploy to Staging

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  trigger_deployment:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger CD workflow
        uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1
        with:
          workflow: CD Pipeline
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          inputs: '{"environment": "staging"}'
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

The monitoring workflow (`monitoring.yml`) automates health checks and performance monitoring.

### Workflow Triggers

The monitoring workflow is triggered on:
- Schedule (every 15 minutes)
- Manual dispatch

### Jobs

1. **Health Check**: Verifies API availability and basic functionality
2. **Performance Check**: Measures API response times and throughput
3. **Security Scan**: Checks for security vulnerabilities (weekly)

### Key Features

- **Automated Alerting**: Notifications on failures
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking of response times and error rates
- **Security Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerabilities
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive reports on API health

### Usage Example

```yaml
# Trigger manual health check
name: Manual Health Check

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  trigger_monitoring:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger monitoring workflow
        uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1
        with:
          workflow: Monitoring
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Advanced Features

### Matrix Builds

Matrix builds allow testing across multiple configurations simultaneously.

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
    mongodb-version: [4.4, 5.0]
```

### Dependency Caching

Caching speeds up workflows by reusing previously downloaded dependencies.

```yaml
- name: Cache node modules
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-npm-
```

### Reusable Workflows

Reusable workflows allow sharing common job definitions across multiple workflows.

```yaml
# Call a reusable workflow
jobs:
  build:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml
    with:
      node-version: '16'
    secrets:
      test-secret: ${{ secrets.TEST_SECRET }}
```

### Composite Actions

Composite actions allow bundling multiple steps into a single, reusable action.

```yaml
# Use a composite action
- name: Setup and test API
  uses: ./.github/actions/setup-and-test
  with:
    node-version: '16'
    mongodb-version: '4.4'
```

### Database Migrations

The database migrations workflow automates database schema changes.

```yaml
# Trigger database migration
name: Run Database Migration

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to run migrations on'
        required: true
        default: 'development'
        type: choice
        options:
          - development
          - staging
          - production
```

### Documentation Generation

The documentation workflow automates API documentation generation and publishing.

```yaml
# Generate and deploy API documentation
name: Generate API Docs

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  trigger_docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger documentation workflow
        uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1
        with:
          workflow: API Documentation Generation
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Dependency Management

The dependency management workflow automates dependency updates and security checks.

```yaml
# Update dependencies
name: Update Dependencies

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      update-type:
        description: 'Type of dependency update'
        required: true
        default: 'minor'
        type: choice
        options:
          - patch
          - minor
          - major
```

### Cross-Repository Coordination

The cross-repository workflow enables coordination between related repositories.

```yaml
# Trigger action in related repository
name: Notify Client Repo

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  trigger_cross_repo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger cross-repository workflow
        uses: benc-uk/workflow-dispatch@v1
        with:
          workflow: Cross-Repository Workflow
          token: ${{ secrets.REPO_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          inputs: '{"action": "notify"}'
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Organization

1. **Modular Workflows**: Split workflows by purpose (CI, CD, monitoring)
2. **Reusable Components**: Use reusable workflows and composite actions
3. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, consistent names for workflows and jobs
4. **Path Filtering**: Trigger workflows only when relevant files change

### Security

1. **Environment Secrets**: Store sensitive information in environment secrets
2. **Least Privilege**: Use minimal permissions for GitHub tokens
3. **Environment Protection**: Require approvals for production deployments
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerabilities

### Performance

1. **Dependency Caching**: Cache dependencies to speed up workflows
2. **Conditional Jobs**: Skip unnecessary jobs based on conditions
3. **Parallel Execution**: Use matrix strategy for parallel testing
4. **Artifact Management**: Only upload necessary artifacts

### Maintainability

1. **Documentation**: Document workflows and their usage
2. **Version Control**: Version workflow files alongside code
3. **Code Reviews**: Review workflow changes like regular code
4. **Testing**: Test workflow changes in isolation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow Not Triggering**
   - Check event triggers and path filters
   - Verify branch names and patterns
   - Check for syntax errors in workflow files

2. **Job Failures**
   - Check logs for specific error messages
   - Verify environment variables and secrets
   - Check for changes in external dependencies

3. **Deployment Issues**
   - Verify environment configuration
   - Check for environment protection rules
   - Ensure proper authentication for deployment targets

### Debugging Techniques

1. **Enable Debug Logging**
   ```yaml
   env:
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
   ```

2. **Use Step Debugging**
   ```yaml
   steps:
     - name: Debug step
       run: |
         echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
         echo "Files: $(ls -la)"
         echo "Environment: ${{ toJSON(env) }}"
   ```

3. **Manual Workflow Dispatch**
   - Use workflow_dispatch event to manually trigger workflows
   - Provide different inputs to test various scenarios

4. **Review Action Runs**
   - Check the Actions tab in GitHub repository
   - Review detailed logs for each step
   - Compare with previous successful runs
