## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of GitHub Actions
- Node.js and npm installed (for local development)

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/naftalysh-org/github_actions_web_api.git
   cd github_actions_web_api
   ```

2. Explore the example API:
   ```
   cd code/example-api
   npm install
   npm test

4. Consult the documentation in the `docs/` directory for detailed information

## Documentation

### Implementation Guide

The [Implementation Guide](docs/implementation_guide.md) provides detailed information about:

- Project structure and organization
- Workflow configurations and their purposes
- Advanced features and how they work
- Best practices for implementation

### Usage Guide

The [Usage Guide](docs/usage_guide.md) offers step-by-step instructions for:

- Setting up your repository
- Configuring GitHub Actions workflows
- Running and monitoring workflows
- Customizing workflows for your needs

### Best Practices

The [Best Practices](docs/best_practices.md) document covers:
